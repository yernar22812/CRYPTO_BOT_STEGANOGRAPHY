# 🕵️‍♂️ Steganography Telegram Bot

This Telegram bot lets you **hide text inside an image** (encoding) and **extract hidden text from an image** (decoding) using basic steganography.

> ⚠️ **Note**: All images are resized to a **fixed size** during processing. If you send a large image, it will be **cropped or resized**, because currently the bot does not support varying image dimensions. This is necessary to avoid errors in image encoding/decoding.  
> ✅ Support for arbitrary image sizes is planned in future versions.
